<p>Edus entered the room to find it a complete mess. Nearly every part of the room was covered in ash. Most paintings were knocked down, and some furniture was knocked over. Rufus himself was standing in the middle of the room, seemingly annoyed at something. Suddenly, the cat hiccuped, and a burst of colorful fireworks expelled from Rufus’s mouth, covering the room in even more ash and knocking the few remaining paintings off of the wall.
Edus walked up to the cat, who was surprisingly calm for a creature that was constantly spewing fireworks. “Now let’s see if we can figure out what’s causing this to happen.” He said as he pulled out what looked like a modified magnifying glass. While it had at one point been a magnifying glass, years of experimenting had left it something greater. It was now a device capable of figuring out the magical components of an unknown spell or potion. Edus had created it himself and named it the Magi-fyng Glass. He had even shown it to the head wizards of MUM. Though the head wizards had not really found it all too exciting.
“Why create such a device when the Magic-Identify Spell exists?” Had been their argument, and Edus could see what they meant. But he was never that good at the Magic-Identify Spell, despite being an Anti-Thaumaturgy Major, hence, his creation of the Magi-fying Glass.
A quick usage of the Magi-fying Glass showed that the origins of Rufus’s colorful hiccups were a combination of Uchrite root, Demon’s Fig seed, and Nervous Polkweed. An interesting combination, he would definitely report to his old potions professor Thedius about this possible discovery. The cure would be simple enough, a potion using Glaxwing feathers and Zixaby hair would create a potent antidote. Edus went downstairs and informed Mr. Hawdon of the cure.
“And how would I go about procuring this potion?” Mr. Hawdon asked.
“There’s a potions shop in the business district that make custom potions, check there,” Edus responded,writing down the address of the shop on a piece of paper and handing it to Mr. Hawdon. “I’ll send you the bill soon,” Edus said as he bid his customer good day, and headed off to his next stop.
